# CaffeGeo

**This is repository contains a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) which supports the HSN, FCN-WeightedBalanced and SegNet(http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/)**

Unpooling layer and weighted balancing are integrated in the original caffe.

The HSN is described in **Hourglass-ShapeNetwork Based Semantic Segmentation for High Resolution Aerial Imagery**Yu Liu, Duc Minh Nguyen, Nikos Deligiannis, Wenrui Ding, Adrian Munteanu. (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/6/522)
